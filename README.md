### Neural Rendering for 3D Reconstruction and View Synthesis: An Overview
#### Spring 2023, CSE 252D: Advanced Computer Vision, UC San Diego

Computer graphics and computer vision have experienced remarkable
advancements in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, primarily
propelled by the emergence of neural networks. In this survey paper, we provide
a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art techniques in neural rendering
for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. We discuss datasets and metrics for
evaluation, trace the evolution from classical methods to neural networks, explore
advancements in image rendering, and focus on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).
We cover NeRF fundamentals, efficiency, sparse data handling, dynamic scenes,
composition, and application-specific NeRFs. We conclude by summarizing key
findings and identifying future research directions.
